Pseudocode for rain inches to gallons:

INITIALIZE rainInches = 1
INITIALIZE roofLength = 1
INITIALIZE roofWidth =1
INITIALIZE galOfWater

DOWHILE roofLength && roofWidth && rainInches are not positive numbers
    IF roofLength || roofWidth || rainInches are not positive numbers
        DISPLAY "Invalid input, please try again."<br>
    ENDIF
    DISPLAY "Please enter the length of the roof in feet: "
    ASSIGN INPUT to roofLength 
    DISPLAY "Please enter the width of the roof in feet: "
    ASSIGN INPUT to roofLength 
    DISPLAY "Please enter inches of rainfall: "
    ASSIGN INPUT to rainInches 
EMDWHILE

ASSIGN roofLength * roofWidth * 12 / 213 to galOfWater 

DISPLAY "A roof $roofLength feet by $roofWidth feet that gets $roofArea inchs of rainfall, will produce $galOfWater gallons of water."
